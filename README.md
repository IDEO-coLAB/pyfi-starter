# pyfi-starter

This is a simple starter/example app for [Pyfi](https://github.com/IDEO-coLAB/pyfi) and [PyFiClient](https://github.com/IDEO-coLAB/pyfi-client).

# Getting started

First, clone this repo.

Then, you'll want to be sure that you're working in a Python 3.4+ environment. You could do that by creating and activating a virtual environment:
```
python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
```

Now you can get up and running in two steps:

```
npm install
```
and finally:
```
npm run dev
```
Now you should be able to access to sample app at `http://localhost:3000`.
